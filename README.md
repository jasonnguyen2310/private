# Project begins

## ASK PHASE

### Questions
* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

My hypothetical manager asked me to answer the first question

What is the problem you are trying to solve? : I'm trying to differentiate between the casual riders and the annual riders.

## PREPARE PHASE
* Since this is a hypothetical situation, I'm going to assume that the data is located in the company database (the data is created by Motivate International Inc)
* The data is organized by the naming convention : YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata. I'm going with the newest set of data in 2023
* Assuming this is a hypothetical situtation, the data should be ROCCC after the first investigation

### Data gathering and tools

I will be using SQL for this analysis. Since it's the first time I work with a large data set like this, I had to dig around to find a way to set up SQL workbench. Refer to this <link> to see the details.
